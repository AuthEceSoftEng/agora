The Abstract Syntax Tree Parser (AST) of AGORA is written in Java. It is based
on the Java compiler and allows exporting the AST of source code files
or projects in JSON format. The tool has a command line interface and can
also be used as a library.

The code is available at <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/AuthEceSoftEng/agora-ast-parser">https://github.com/AuthEceSoftEng/agora-ast-parser</a>

The tool can be built using maven, using the command:

```mvn install```

Note that the AST parser of AGORA can also be used as a standalone tool, as described in the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/AuthEceSoftEng/agora-ast-parser/blob/master/README.md">readme</a> of its repository.
